This project aims to provide some insights into how different cryptocurrency prices correlate to each other.

The current method used to determine correlation is r^2 values over a moving timespan of 1 year.
As my knowledge in Data Analytics increase, I will update this project to be even more accurate.

The Cryptocurrencies measured are:
Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin, Ripple, Stellar, Dash, Monero, NEM, Bitshares,Dogecoin, 0x,OmiseGo,Lisk and Steemit.

Will also work on a recommendation model that uses sentiment analysis to recommend coins to buy based on high price correlations.
